Day 22: Binary Search Trees
ðŸ§  Task
Given the root of a binary search tree (BST), calculate its height.
Height is the number of edges between the root and the deepest leaf node.

ðŸ§ª Sample Input
7  
3  
5  
2  
1  
4  
6  
7

âœ… Sample Output
3

ðŸ§¾ Explanation
The input values are inserted into a BST.
The longest path from root to a leaf node has 3 edges (e.g. 3 â†’ 5 â†’ 6 â†’ 7), so the height is 3.

âœ… Concepts Covered 
Binary Search Tree construction

Recursion

Tree height calculation using DFS

Base case & recursive traversal logic

ðŸš€ What I Learned
How binary trees grow with each inserted node

How height is counted in edges, not nodes

The power of recursion in solving tree-based problems

Clean separation of insert and height logic in class-based design

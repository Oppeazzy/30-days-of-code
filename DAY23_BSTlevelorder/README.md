Day 23: BST Level-Order Traversal
ðŸ§  Task
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), perform a level-order traversal (also known as breadth-first traversal) and print each nodeâ€™s value from top to bottom, left to right.

ðŸ“¥ Input Format
he first line contains an integer T, the number of nodes.

Each of the next T lines contains an integer to insert into the BST.

ðŸ“¤ Output Format
Print the space-separated level-order traversal of the BST.

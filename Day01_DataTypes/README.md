# Day 1: Data Types

This folder contains my solution to **Day 1** of [HackerRank’s 30 Days of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code).



## 🔸 Problem Summary

You are given:
- An integer `i = 4`

Your task is to:
1. Read another **integer**, **double**, and **string** from input
2. Print the **sum of integers**
3. Print the **sum of doubles** (with 1 decimal)
4. Print the **concatenation** of the strings

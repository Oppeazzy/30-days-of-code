# Day 14: Scope

## Task

Complete the class `Difference` by writing a method `computeDifference()` that calculates the **maximum absolute difference** between any two elements in an array of integers.

## Input Format

* First line: An integer `n`, the number of elements.
* Second line: `n` space-separated integers, the elements of the array.

## Output Format

* A single integer: The maximum absolute difference between any two elements.



## Sample Input
3  
1 2 5  

## Sample Output
4  

## Explanation

* The maximum absolute difference is `|1 - 5| = 4`.

## âœ… What I Learned

* How to find the min and max in an array
* How to compute absolute differences
* Using constructors and class methods in C++
* Strengthened array manipulation and class design skills

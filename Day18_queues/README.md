Day 18: Queues and Stacks
ðŸ§  Task
Given a string s, determine whether it is a palindrome using a stack and a queue.

ðŸ“¥ Sample Input
racecar
ðŸ“¤ Sample Output
arduino

The word, racecar, is a palindrome.
ðŸ“„ Explanation
A stack (LIFO) and a queue (FIFO) are both used to store characters.

By comparing the characters popped from the stack and dequeued from the queue, we can verify if the string reads the same forward and backward.

âœ… Concepts Covered
Stacks and Queues

Using STL containers like stack and queue

String manipulation and comparisons

Object-oriented approach with classes and encapsulation

ðŸš€ What I Learned
The difference between FIFO (queue) and LIFO (stack) structures

How to use push, pop, front, and top functions

Applying data structures to solve real-world problems like palindrome checking

Day 19: Interfaces
🧠 Task
Create an interface called AdvancedArithmetic with a method int divisorSum(int n). Then, write a class Calculator that implements this interface and returns the sum of all divisors of the given integer n.

🧪 Sample Input
6

📤 Sample Output
I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic
12
🔍 Explanation
Divisors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6

Their sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12

Calculator successfully implements the AdvancedArithmetic interface.

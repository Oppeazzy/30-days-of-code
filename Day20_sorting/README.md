Day 20: Sorting
🧠 Task
Given an array of integers, use Bubble Sort to sort the array.
You must output:

Total number of swaps performed.

First element of the sorted array.

Last element of the sorted array

📥 Sample Input

3  
3 2 1
📤 Sample Output
mathematica

Array is sorted in 3 swaps.  
First Element: 1  
Last Element: 3

🔍 Explanation
Original array: 3 2 1

After first pass: 2 1 3

After second pass: 1 2 3

Total swaps: 3

First element = 1

Last element = 3

✅ Concepts Covered
Bubble sort logic

Array swapping

Counting operations in a loop

Early exit optimization (if no swaps in a pass)

🚀 What I Learned

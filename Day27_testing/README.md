## Day 27: Testing

## 📌 Problem Description
This challenge focuses on **creating test cases** to verify that a given function `minimum_index` works correctly under various scenarios.

You are asked to:
1. Implement `minimum_index(seq)`, which returns the index of the smallest element in an array.
2. Handle an **empty array** by throwing an exception.
3. Create **three classes** to supply test data:
   - `TestDataEmptyArray` – returns an empty array.
   - `TestDataUniqueValues` – returns an array with unique elements and the index of the smallest element.
   - `TestDataExactlyTwoDifferentMinimums` – returns an array with exactly two minimum elements and the index of the first minimum.

The solution includes functions that automatically test these scenarios using assertions.


## 🖥️ Input 
No direct input (tests are built-in).  
## 🖥️ Output 
OK

## 📚 Concepts Covered
- **Exception Handling (`throw`, `try`, `catch`)**
- **Assertions (`assert`)** to validate conditions during testing.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** for structuring test data providers.
- **Vectors and STL** (`vector`, `set`, `sort`) for handling and verifying arrays.
- **Edge Case Testing** to ensure robustness of the solution.



## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to **write automated tests** for verifying program correctness.
- How to handle **edge cases** gracefully with exceptions.
- How to **design clean test data classes** for structured testing.
- The importance of **assertions** in debugging and validating code logic.
